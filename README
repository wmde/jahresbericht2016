-- Distribution for Atelier Disko projects.

-- REPLACE THIS README WITH YOUR PROJECT'S README  --
-- REPLACE THE LICENSE WITH YOUR PROJECT'S LICENSE --

Abstract
--------
This is an application distribution. This distribution is providing a
boilerplate for Atelier Disko projects and contains confidential and
proprietary code.

This distribution especially is made for "micro" projects. Such a project
doesn't have a backend but consists of plain HTML files, CSS and JS.

HTML
----
HTML files are to be placed in `app/webroot/`.

Autoloading of CSS and JS
-------------------------
These libaries will always be loaded and bootstrap
the applications JavaScript, they must always be present:

  - assets/js/jquery.js
  - assets/js/require.js
  - assets/js/base.js

These Stylesheets are always loaded and must be present:

  - asssets/css/reset.css
  - asssets/css/base.css

Inside `assets/js` you'll find `base.js` which is used for
requireJS configuration and loading. Script files that are included
directly are contained inside `assets/js/views/`.

Initializing
------------
$ cd /path/to/project
$ make install

$ cd /path/to/project/bin
$ ./deta create-config.sh

You now must now define which of the available environments
is the current active one for your environment. In the example below we
select the VM environment as our current one.

$ cd ../config
$ ls -l *.env
$ rm current.env
$ ln -s vm.env current.env

Running Tasks
-------------
The distribution comes with some useful scripts that help with setting up the application
and reaching as far as deploying the whole project. These tasks can be listed and
executed as follows. Tasks are based on deta[1], for more information see the
deta projects documentation.

$ cd /path/to/project/bin
$ ./deta
$ ./deta fix-perms.sh
